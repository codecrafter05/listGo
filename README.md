# Team Task Manager App

We have designed a robust Task Manager application utilizing Express Node.js and React, taking inspiration from the popular project management tool, Trello. This application is designed to facilitate efficient management and delegation of tasks between admins and users.

## App Overview

This application is designed to streamline task management within a team. Admins can create, assign, edit, and delete tasks for all users, allowing them to effectively manage their team's workload. Users can view their tasks, mark them as complete, and add notes or comments, fostering a collaborative environment. Admins can also monitor the progress of tasks and set deadlines, ensuring projects are completed in a timely manner.
